# RUSTSEC-2023-0071: RSA timing sidechannel (Marvin Attack)
# Justification: sqlx-mysql is in Cargo.lock but not actually used.
# We only use the 'postgres' feature of sqlx. The mysql backend depends on
# rsa for MySQL's authentication protocol, but it's never compiled into our binary.
# Verified with: cargo tree --edges normal -i rsa (returns "nothing to print")
